# Key management and protections

## Why is it important 

Key Management is tricky. For example, let's imagine we have a bunch of keys that we want to protect. 
One way to do so is by trying to encrypt them. But then, with which key? And then, how do we securely store that key? 

Secure processors have the ability to answer this problem. 

## How Secure processors protects keys

## Key Management functions 
Security processors also need to be able to compute cryptographic functions, and they're a lot. 
For example, to be able to generate keys of specific format from existing secret keys, we need Key Derivation Functions (KDFs).
