# Security Features and implementations

In this chapter we will discuss in more detail the security features that are implemented by a confidential computing environment. 
This part should present a first definition for attestation and sealing, how memory and processes are supposed to be protected and how cryptography is implemented in enclaves. 

## Attestation 

Also known as cryptographic attestation, aims to ensures the integrity and authenticity of data, software or hardware components. Simply put, the attestation is a digital signature for a set of measurements securely stored in hardware that can be validated by a requester. 

See the [attestation part](./2_attestation.md) to know more about the different models of attestation and implementations.

## Sealing 

Sealing is defined as a way to protect persistent and stored data.  



## Cryptographic operations
