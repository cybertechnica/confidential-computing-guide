# Security Features and implementations

In this chapter we will discuss in more detail the security features that are implemented by a confidential computing environment. 
This part should present a first definition for attestation and sealing, how memory and processes are supposed to be protected and how cryptography is implemented in enclaves. 

## Attestation 

Also known as cryptographic attestation, aims to ensures the integrity and authenticity of data, software or hardware components. 


## Sealing 

## Cryptographic operations
