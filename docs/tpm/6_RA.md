# Remote attestation in TPM

The example presented in this chapter relies on the tutorial from the [TPM2 community](https://tpm2-software.github.io/2020/06/12/Remote-Attestation-With-tpm2-tools.html). 

The attestation workflow will be done in Rust. 

## Communication workflow 

Remote attestation is the mechanism that is built to establish trust with a remote device through attestation. 
Platform anonymity. 
#### Attestation Procedure
Before a system can be attested the owner needs to obtain the public key of the TPM Vendor EK and OEM generated Attestation Key along with the appropriate certificates.
