# General overview

Trusted Platform Modules (TPMs) are security chips that aims to protect data and its integrity on

- [Trusted Platform Module Library Specification : Architecture](https://trustedcomputinggroup.org/wp-content/uploads/TPM-2.0-1.83-Part-1-Architecture.pdf) : *Part 1 of the specification, it defines the architecture and every feature of what is supported in a TPM.*
- [Trusted Platform Module Library Specification : Structures](https://trustedcomputinggroup.org/wp-content/uploads/TPM-2.0-1.83-Part-2-Structures.pdf) : *The Part 2 of the specification is for the definition of the structures used in the TPM.* 
- [Trusted Platform Module Library Specification : Commands](https://trustedcomputinggroup.org/wp-content/uploads/TPM-2.0-1.83-Part-3-Commands.pdf): *Part 3 defines the commands and functions used to send to the TPM.*
- [Trusted Platform Module Library Specification : Supporting Routines](https://trustedcomputinggroup.org/wp-content/uploads/TPM-2.0-1.83-Part-4-Supporting-Routines.pdf) : *Part 4 describes the subroutines called by the commands in Part 3.*
