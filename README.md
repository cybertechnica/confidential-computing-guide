# Confidential Computing Guide (In Trust We compute)    

## What is this? 

Here you'll find some documents explaining concepts around confidential computing. 

The objective of this resources is to detail most of the concepts around TEEs and TPMs. Each concepts will be followed by an example that shows how it is used. 
The goal is to democratize this technology, and maybe find new ways of usage outside of specific use-cases. 

Specifically, this guide tries to answer the issue of having a guide that explains all the subtelties around the different technologies, develop tutorials and debugging methods, and explain the security concepts around these technologies.  

One other important subject, is to gather the security research done in TEEs, so that we can explain how to mitigate and research TEEs.
